# File Integrity Monitoring with Wazuh - Windows and Ubuntu

### 1. Description

This home lab project focuses on implementing File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring solution. The FIM will be implemented for Windows Server 2022 and Ubuntu 24.04. FIM is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of files on systems by detecting unauthorized changes, which could indicate potential security breaches or system tampering


### 2. Objectives

- Set up a Wazuh server to collect and analyze security data.
- Set up and configure agents on target systems (Windows and Ubuntu) to monitor specific files and directories for changes.
- Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of any detected file changes.
- Generate reports to track changes over time and assess compliance with security policies.


### 3. Tools and Technologies Used

- **VirtualBox**: Used for creating virtual machines for the lab environment.
- **Wazuh**: SIEM tool for log management and security monitoring;
- **Windows Server 2022**: Used as a monitored system;
- **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**: Used as a monitored system.

   - **Components**:
     - **Wazuh Manager**: Centralized management console.
     - **Agent Nodes**: Installed on target systems (Windows and Ubuntu Servers) to collect logs.

### 5. Installation Steps
   - **5.1. Setting Up VirtualBox**

For setting up VirtualBox, refer to <a href="https://github.com/Muhate/Setting-Up-VirtualBox">this guide</a>

   - **5.3: Setting Up Wazuh Manager on Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**

     - After logging into the server, update the package manager:
       ```
       sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo reboot
       ```
     - Install Wazuh Manager and all other components:
       ```
       curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
       ```

   - **Step 3: Configuring Wazuh**
     - Modify the configuration file (`/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`) to set up agents and alerts.
     - Restart Wazuh Manager:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
       ```

### 5. **Generating Test Data**
   - **Kali Linux Testing**: 
     - Execute various tests to generate logs (e.g., using Metasploit, Nmap).
     - Sample command to generate logs:
       ```bash
       nmap -sS -p 1-65535 <target_ip>
       ```

### 6. **Results and Analysis**
   - **Data Visualization**: 
     - Showcase screenshots of dashboards in Kibana that display security events, logs, and alerts.
   - **Alerts Configuration**:
     - Explain how alerts were configured in Wazuh and provide examples of alerts generated during testing.

### 7. **Challenges and Solutions**
   - **Challenge**: Difficulty in integrating Wazuh with Elastic Stack.
     - **Solution**: Consulted official documentation and community forums, which helped resolve configuration issues.

### 8. **Lessons Learned**
   - Gained hands-on experience in setting up a complete SIEM solution.
   - Improved understanding of log analysis and incident response workflows.

### 9. **Future Improvements**
   - Plan to integrate additional data sources (e.g., firewalls, web servers).
   - Explore automated incident response mechanisms using Wazuh.

### 10. **Conclusion**
   - This project successfully demonstrated the deployment of Wazuh in a lab environment, providing valuable insights into security monitoring and log analysis.
